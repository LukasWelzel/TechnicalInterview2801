The Webapplication acts as a Server to the C# client application therefore the NodeServer and Webserver need to be started first


To Start the Node server either type npm start into the Visual Studio Code console or navigate a terminal to the server.js file and type node *server.js*
Start the webserver on which the Webapplication is hosted in my test case i used Xampp.
Delete the Files currently contained in the htdocs folder within the Xampp Directory.
Copy the Webapp files into the htdocs folder.

To run the C# app: 
After running it once from Visual studio goto the folder ../TechnicalInterView2801-LocalApplication/NetzschLocalApp/bin/Release 
there should be an executable contained withing the folder.
